# Peakbreaker Install Endless Scripts (PIES)

**Basically this is a repo for autoinstalling packages and whatnot**

I ran out of patience with configuration of my development enviroment, so I sat
down, researched what other clever people are doing, and started outlining how
I want my automatic installs to be.  Basically my devenv is split in two:

- PIES for scripts and automatic installations of stuff
- .dotfiles for all configuration files, no scripts

My goal is to sit back and let my scripts do all the work of setting up my
system for me.
